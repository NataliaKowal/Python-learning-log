## Rock Paper Scissors Game

# How to Play
Run the script in a Python environment.
Input 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors when prompted.
The computer's choice is randomly generated.
The script displays both the player's and the computer's choices using ASCII art.
The winner is determined by the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

# Rules
Rock beats Scissors.
Scissors beats Paper.
Paper beats Rock.
If both the player and the computer choose the same, the game is a draw.

# Error Handling
If a player inputs an invalid number (less than 0 or greater than 2), the script will output "You typed an invalid number, you lose!"

# Requirements
This script requires Python to run. No additional libraries are necessary since it uses the built-in random module.
